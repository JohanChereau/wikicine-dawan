## Introduction

🎬 **Wikiciné** is an innovative project developed by three dynamic developers as part of our training at [Dawan](https://www.dawan.fr/), a renowned training center with over 24 years of experience and more than 2000 courses. Dawan is committed to fostering a love for learning, understanding, and sharing, ensuring the best environment, content, and trainers for its students.

### Background and Origin

🌟 Wikiciné was born out of our desire to enhance our skills through a concrete team project. We identified the need for a centralized and interactive platform dedicated to movie enthusiasts, where users can access comprehensive movie information, reviews, and discussions.

### Objectives

🎯 Our project has several key objectives:

- **Skill Development**: To improve our competencies in coding, project management, UI/UX design, accessibility, GDPR compliance, and both front-end and back-end development.

- **Centralized Information**: To provide a single platform offering detailed information about movies, including synopses, cast and crew details, and user reviews.

- **User Engagement**: To create an interactive environment where users can contribute their own reviews, ratings, and discussions.

- **Professional Workflow**: To follow an agile Scrum workflow, utilizing GitHub for project management and ticketing, simulating a real-world professional environment.

🎥 Wikiciné is more than just a movie database; it is a community-driven project that aims to enrich the movie-watching experience by providing detailed insights and fostering a vibrant community of film enthusiasts.

## Live Demos

## Project Description

### What

🎬 **Wikiciné** is a web application designed to be a comprehensive platform for movie enthusiasts. It provides a space where users can access detailed information about nearly a million movies from around the world, as well as insights into the stars of the cinema, including actors, producers, directors, and other film industry professionals.

### Who

👥 **Target Audience**: Wikiciné is aimed at a diverse community that includes movie amateurs, passionate cinephiles, and industry professionals. This platform is built to cater to anyone with an interest in the world of cinema.

### Why

❓ **Reason for Creation**: The motivation behind creating Wikiciné stems from the observation that there are very few applications that facilitate sharing and discussions about the behind-the-scenes aspects of the movie industry. We wanted to create a platform that brings together the audience and the stars, fostering a space for exchange and engagement.

### How

🔧 **Functionality**: Wikiciné allows movie lovers to debate and share their opinions through a comment section. It serves as a repository of extensive information on movies and film personalities, enabling users to explore and learn about different facets of the movie industry. Moreover, film professionals can share their experiences, anecdotes, and challenges faced during their careers, enriching the community with authentic industry insights. The platform is designed to create a strong connection between movie stars and their fans, allowing for direct interaction and community building, thus bridging the gap between the public and their favorite cinema icons.

## Mockups and Design

🎨 **Crafted with Precision: Modern, Mobile-First Design**

Our journey through Wikiciné's design began with a commitment to excellence in user experience. Embracing a mobile-first approach, we envisioned a seamless transition from smartphones to larger screens like tablets and PCs, ensuring every interaction feels intuitive and engaging.

### Figma: Where Creativity Meets Functionality

In Figma, we meticulously crafted each screen to embody modern aesthetics while prioritizing usability. From the sleek registration and login pages to the vibrant homepage, every element was meticulously placed to enhance user interaction and visual appeal.

## Future Improvements

🔧 **Ongoing Development**: The project is still under active development, with several features yet to be fully implemented. Our goal is to take Wikiciné to new heights, extending its reach internationally and enhancing its functionality.

- **Administrative Tools and Favorites List**: Development is underway for comprehensive administrative tools and a robust favorites list feature. These will include options to manage user roles, moderate comments, and provide users with a personalized list of favorite movies.
- **User Experience Enhancements**: We aim to refine the user experience to make it truly unique. This includes adding clear indicators for actions that require an account, such as posting comments, to ensure users understand the platform's requirements and capabilities.

- **Profile Personalization**: We want to offer more options for users to personalize their profiles. This will allow each member to express their opinions and create a profile that truly represents their personality.

- **Complete Wiki System**: While the current wiki functionality is operational, we aim to build a more comprehensive system. This will enable multiple contributors to actively participate in creating and editing wiki pages using the integrated markdown editor.

- **Verification System**: By default, all users have the "user" role. We are exploring a reliable verification system for cinema stars (contributors) to obtain a contributor role without requiring admin intervention. This might involve a request system where admins can approve or deny role changes, ensuring genuine cinema star accounts without fake profiles or other issues.

## Project Structure

The project is structured with a focus on separation of concerns to ensure maintainability, cleanliness, and organization. This approach helps in clearly delineating responsibilities and maintaining a structured codebase.

### Directory Structure

```bash
src/
├── assets/
├── components/
│   ├── layout/
│   ├── ui/
│   └── modals/
├── hooks/
├── pages/
├── services/
│   ├── api/
│   ├── providers/
│   └── supabase/
├── utils/
│   ├── icons/
│   ├── string/
│   └── style/
├── App.jsx
├── index.css
└── main.jsx
```

### Overview

- **`assets/`**: Contains project-wide assets such as images, fonts, etc.
- **`components/`**: Houses reusable UI components structured into `layout/`, `ui/` for presentational components, and `modals/` for modal components.

- **`hooks/`**: Custom React hooks used throughout the application for managing state and logic.

- **`pages/`**: Contains top-level React components representing different pages/routes of the application.

- **`services/`**: Includes modules for handling different aspects of the application's backend integration:

  - **`api/`**: Handles API communication.
  - **`providers/`**: Manages context providers for state management.
  - **`supabase/`**: Integrates with Supabase for authentication, database operations, and real-time capabilities.

- **`utils/`**: Utility functions and helper modules categorized into `icons/`, `string/`, and `style/` for managing icon sets, string manipulations, and styles respectively.

### Purpose

The project structure is designed with a primary focus on separation of concerns and maintainability. This approach aims to achieve the following:

- **Clarity**: Organizing components, hooks, and utilities into separate directories enhances code readability and ease of navigation.

- **Modularity**: Dividing functionality into discrete modules promotes reusability and facilitates easier testing and debugging.

- **Scalability**: By establishing a structured architecture, the project becomes more adaptable to future changes and additions, ensuring scalability as the application grows.

- **Collaboration**: Clear separation of responsibilities among different modules fosters efficient collaboration among team members, enabling them to work on different parts of the application independently.

- **Long-term Maintenance**: Maintaining a clean and well-organized codebase reduces technical debt and simplifies ongoing maintenance tasks, ensuring the project remains robust and sustainable over time.
